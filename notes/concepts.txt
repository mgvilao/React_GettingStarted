React.js

Prerequisite: JavaScript

Module 2 - The Basics
    Basics of JavaScript (need to know to make the most out of this course)
        variables and types
        objects and arrays
        functions and classes
        loops and conditionals

    Why React?
        A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
            not a framework, will need other libraries to build full solutions
            if the device we're trying to interface can understand JavaScript, we can use React to describe a user interface for it 
        Mostly used for describing web user interfaces
        HTML - declarative for static content
        React - declarative for dynamic content
        Disadvantages of frameworks (and why it's a good React isn't one)
            Limited flexibility
                do things a certain way
                hard to deviate
            Large and full of features
                hard to customize
                use the whole thing 
        The "virtual" browser (vs. DOM API)
        "Just JavaScript"
        React Native (for the win) - mobile yay
        Battle-tested
        Declarative language (model UI and state)

    React's Basic Concepts
        Three simple and fundamental concepts:
        1) Components 
            like functions
            input: props, state | output: UI
            reusable and composable
            not invoked but used as a regular HTML element <Component />
            can manage a private state
        2) Reactive updates
            when the state of a React component changes, the UI it represents changes as well
            React will react (HA!)
        3) Virtual views in memory
            generate HTML using JavaScript
            no HTML template language
            tree reconciliation
            React uses the virtual DOM to compare versions of the UI in memory before acting on them
        React Components - Function component | Class component
            Function component
                much simpler
                preferable for starters
            Class component
                more powerful
            First react component - Demo on jscomplete.com/playground
            The code in the playground compiles because it's JSX, not HTML
            using Babel to convert JSX into React API calls
            REMEMBER: Always name React components with an Uppercase letter
            immutable props. mutable state

    Block scope vs Function scope
        Both made with pair of curly braces
        Variables defined with var inside functions cannot be accessed outside function scope but those defined with var inside block scope
            like for loops can be accessed outside block scope
        In order to avoid bugs, use let keyword when defining variables in scope
